**CopperCrafting** is a Fabric mod that adds copper tools and armor and other recipes revolving around copper. The goal was to make copper more interesting and useful, while trying to feel just like a piece of the vanilla item material progression.


## Blocks

### **Light Counting Pressure Plate**  

  This pressure plate is a bit different from the vanilla pressure plate, as it **counts each item** on it, not each entity.
  This means items in stacks are correctly counted.

  > Outputs **one** redstone signal for each **item**/entity on the pressure plate.


## Tools

**Copper tools** can mine the same things as **stone** tools.

**Copper tools** have a  mining speed between **stone** and **iron** tools.

**Copper tools** sit between stone and iron tools when it comes to durability.

**Copper tools** are ***highly enchantable***, almost as much as gold.
